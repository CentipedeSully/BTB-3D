Core abilities are the foundational capabilities that higher-level behaviors
utilize to peform more complex actions

examples of core abilities include
 - Moving to a position
 - Gaining or Losing Health
 - Carrying an Inventory

These core abilities are shared between behaviors; All behaviors that 
move the unit will use the coreMovementAbility to accomplish the movement, for 
example (assuming the movement itself isn't extraordinary --ex: teleporting)
